# MPD-Widget

This is a small Java project I did some years ago (2013 IIRC) to learn how to make GUIs in Java. I used this program for a while, as I used to have MPD installed in my laptop and a Raspberry Pi and it allowed me to control both servers quickly with only what I needed. 

I rescued this project recently to do some tests in my new laptop and realized the code quality is really poor and would need a major refactor (or start from scratch, it's not that big), but probably I won't use MPD as a music player (I've been using Spotify for a while), so I don't think I'll dedicate more time to this project for now. This is how it looks like (chunky default java interface):
